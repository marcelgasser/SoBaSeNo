# SoBaSeNo - Solar Battery Powered ESP32 Sensor Node

Design goals:

- ESP32 module based sensor node
- RTC timed measurement cycle enables load switch for minimal power consumption
- Operation on LiFePO4 battery level (2.7-3.5V) without voltage regulator
- Wide input voltage range solar battery charger (4.5-28V)
- USB-C to UART interface for programming of the ESP32
- Modular design with baseboard and extensions
